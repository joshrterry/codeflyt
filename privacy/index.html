        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the Tripi app for iOS.</p>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in Tripi.</p>
            <p>Individual preferences pertaining to Tripi are not personal and are stored only on your device. You will also be asked to provide Tripi with access to your location as well as motion updates, but this is only to assist with essential features within the app used to log your drives and provide intelligent alerts to remind you to end trip tracking when you have reached your destination. You are not required to provide the app will continuous location access, but this may result in some of the features not working as expected. All of this data is stored 100% on-device, so it is not uploaded anywhere else and can only be accessed by you. Tripi has no access to personally identifiable information such as your name, contact information, or Apple ID, and at no point do we ask you to create an account.</p>
            <p>In summary, all data is stored locally on your iPhone unless you choose to export trip data for sharing. Tripi is not responsible for how this data is shared, and we encourage all our users to be mindful of who they choose to share this data with.</p>

            <p>To help us better understand how people use Tripi and to continue improving it, we use analytics information provided by App Store Connect.

        <h2>Consent</h2>
